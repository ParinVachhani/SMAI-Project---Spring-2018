#Project title:
Online Active Linear Regression via Thresholding (AAAI 2017)

#Broad area:
Machine Learning, Online Learning, Linear Regression

#Description:
We consider the problem of online active learning to collect data for regression modeling. Specifically, we consider a decision maker with a limited experimen- tation budget who must efficiently learn an underlying linear population model. Our main contribution is a novel threshold-based algorithm for selection of most informative observations; we characterize its performance and fundamental lower bounds. We extend the algorithm and its guarantees to sparse linear regression in high-dimensional settings.
